          <li>Rule 1: Team Select
              <p>
                  Each competitor selects four Pokemon from their Battle Team to battle with. At the start of
                  the battle, competitors send out the first two Pokémon in their party, making a total of four
                  Pokemon on the battlefield. Gameplay continues until a competitor makes all four of their
                  opponent’s Pokémon faint or until the in-game time limit has expired.
              </p>

                          (including—but not limited to—rewards earned through participation in online battles
                          and other functions of games released by The Pokemon Company and Nintendo) or
