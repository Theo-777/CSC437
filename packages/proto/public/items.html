        <h2>Effect</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Gen IV</dt>
          <dd>If the holder has full HP and is hit by a move that would otherwise cause fainting (including a one-hit knockout move), the Focus Sash will enable it to survive with 1 HP. The Focus Sash can also protect against self-inflicted confusion damage. It can protect from all strikes of a multistrike move, but not from damage from Future Sight or Doom Desire. Once the Focus Sash is used up, it will disappear from your inventory.</dd>
          <dt>Gen V Onwards</dt>
          <dd>From Generation V on, the Focus Sash will only protect its holder from the first strike of a multistrike move.
